        <h1>Quotes</h1>
        <p>
            At a few points in my life, teams or organizations have had whiteboards of quotes.
            One of my favorite and formative games, Civilization IV, had a quote read by Leonard Nimoy every time you researched a technology.
            Sometimes I enjoy some combination of silliness and wisdom from quotes, both in and out of context.
            Somewhat for fun, somewhat so you can see a bit of my personal influences, I include some quotes that I enjoy for some reason or other below.
            There is currently no rhyme or reason to their order, but attribution is given wherever possible.
