        <h1>Quotes</h1>
        <p>
            At a few points in my life, teams or organizations have had whiteboards of quotes.
            One of my favorite and formative games, Civilization IV, had a quote read by Leonard Nimoy every time you researched a technology.
            Sometimes I enjoy some combination of silliness and wisdom from quotes, both in and out of context.
            Somewhat for fun, somewhat so you can see a bit of my personal influences, I include some quotes that I enjoy for some reason or other below.
            There is currently no rhyme or reason to their order, but attribution is given wherever possible.

                This is my senior quote for my high school yearbook.

                I personally sometimes use the variant, "slower is faster,"
                which is itself adapted from my dad's admonition to practice slower because then I would master a passage faster.
