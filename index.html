        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            In my career, I am an R&D S&E (meaning research and development scientist/engineer type person) at
            <a href="https://www.sandia.gov">Sandia National Laboratories</a>.
            I was previously a computer programmer in the neuroimaging space, and before that a Physics PhD dropout, and before that a physics guy who studied raindrops.
            It's been a bit of a weird journey.
            Most of my work revolves around programming and technical support.
            For my most up to date work, see my active projects page.
            I have also become heavily involved with the United States Research Software Engineer Association,
            where I am currently Chair of the Code of Conduct working group and Co-chair of the Outreach working group.
            Outside of work, I also have a variety of hobbies.
            I have hobbies that do no favors for programmer stereotypes, like video games and tabletop games,
            and hobbies that would be very difficult to guess, like collecting fountain pens.
            I currently live in Massillon, Ohio, with my wife and two dogs.

            A set of companion questions and exercises to go with Pro Git.
            I may eventually expand on this, but currently it's designed to be used with Pro Git chapters 1-3.

            A guide to get up and running with LaTeX.
            Originally targeted towards physicists but broadly useful for anyone expecting to write LaTeX documents with citations, figures, or math.
