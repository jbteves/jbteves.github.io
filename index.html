        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            In my career, I am a staff programmer in
            <a href="https://fim.nimh.nih.gov/profiles/peter-bandettini-phd">Peter Bandettini's</a>
            lab, the
            <a href="https://fim.nimh.nih.gov">Section on Functional Imaging Methods</a>.
            Most of my work revolves around programming and technical support.
            For my most up to date work, see my active projects page.
            Outside of work, I also have a variety of hobbies.
            I have hobbies that do no favors for programmer stereotypes, like video games and tabletop games,
            and hobbies that would be very difficult to guess, like collecting fountain pens.
            I currently live in Charleston, South Carolina, with my wife and two dogs.
