<h1>Meditations</h1>
<h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>
I kind of slogged through this one, I felt that many of the points were hammered on repeatedly.
Granted, it's some guys private journal that accidentally became a philosophy classic.
That said, I think I disagree with some of the premises as they're applied to normal people.
For example, Marcus Aurelius was primarily concerned with running an empire, which is not something that most people need to concern themselves with.
Additionally, he has the premise that things don't matter because when you compare them to the infinite time before and after your life, it's very small.
Yet, his words have remained relevant over a thousand years later, and probably been a foundation of philosophical thought for many people.
That seems significant, even in the grand scheme of things.
But I tend to vacillate back and forth on how much motes of dust scattered on a great cosmic wand actually matter, so I may have a different view later.
