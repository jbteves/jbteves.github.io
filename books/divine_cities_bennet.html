<h1>The Divie Cities Trilogy</h1>
<h2>Robert Jackson Bennett</h2>
I'll go over the whole trilogy here because I bought the whole thing as an omnibus.
I was interested in this after enjoying Robert Jackson Bennett's other book series, Foundryside.
The premise was an interesting one: that there was some relationship between what people thought of deities, and how those deities acted.
It's a premise that's been worked over in many other contexts, too, but I thought that this series had a fresh take.
It also, like Foundryside, weaves in things that are more typically fantasy in a setting with emerging industry.
Though I enjoyed the characters in Foundryside, I actually felt I got a more in-depth and enjoyable picture of them within this series.
I particularly enjoyed the character of Sigrud.
