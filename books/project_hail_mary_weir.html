<h1>Project Hail Mary</h1>
<h2>Andy Weir</h2>
<p>
    I'm not actually going to review the book, though I thought it was very good.
    Instead I'm going to share the saga of reading it.
    For starters, I had an unfavorable view of reading it because every time I see a paper copy of The Martian I instantly feel like no human being should have the time to read it, and the last time I saw a book like that it was Dune.
    I found Dune good but far too long.
    Several friends and a colleague had said they liked it and I should really read it, but I kept thinking of The Martian and how onerous it looked and how the same guy wrote both.
    Then, I got a paperback of it in a family book exchange, and I thought, "Well, fine, I'll read the damn thing."
    I was swept up immediately and wanted to stay up reading even when it was getting late, like I do for only very good books, and was full speed ahead.
    That is, until a sentence didn't finish on the next page.
    In my confusion, I re-read three times, until I realized that the page numbers were wrong--I was missing about 60 pages in this print.
    It was at a very climactic part of the novel and I was moved to violence, ready to swear a blood feud against the publisher (and I am still rankled writing this months later, because how do miss <b>sixty pages</b>) but then I realized I could buy and then return the digital edition through Apple Books, so I read the missing chapters and then resumed back on the paperback.
    Anyway, do better, Ballantine Books.
