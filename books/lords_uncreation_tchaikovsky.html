<h1>The Lords of Uncreation</h1>
<h2>Adrian Tchaikovsky</h2>
This was an epic conclusion to Adrian Tchaikovsky's "The Final Architecture" series.
Though strange at turns, it brilliantly concludes this magnificient space opera.
I enjoyed the pacing, the plot twists and turns, and felt that the resolution was unimpeachable.
My hopes going in were high and Tchaikovsky managed to exceed them.
A really excellent series to the end.
