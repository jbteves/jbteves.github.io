<h1>Apocalypse Cow</h1>
<h2>Michael Logan</h2>
A fun comedy-horror following the travails of Glaswegians surviving the outbreak of a virus.
This is maybe less fun that it might have been pre-covid, with some things completely off the mark and some of them unsettlingly accurate.
I enjoyed reading this after having been in Glasgow in summer 2022, and having had to buy some spare boxers at a Primark mentioned in the book after my luggage was severely delayed.
I enjoyed the plot and its execution, with a few exchanges sending me into fits of giggles.
There was also this (vaguely spoiler-y) exchange that I just loved:

    <blockquote>
        'I'm not bloody English, I'm Scottish,' Terry shouted at the camera.

    <blockquote>
        There was a crackly pause. 'Then we will still shoot you, we just will not enjoy it as much.'
