<h1>To Sleep In a Sea of Stars</h1>
<h2>Christopher Paolini</h2>
I really wanted to like this book.
Some of the ideas were really cool, but the execution left much to be desired.
I had thought that the verbosity of Paolini's Eragon series was due to his youth and inability to cut content, but I think that's just his voice.
If you're the kind of person who likes cool ideas and doesn't mind a very long and questionable execution, this book is for you.
If you think that maybe, after a climax, one hundred pages is pushing it, don't bother.
